Introduction
============

Thrift is a lightweight, language-independent software stack with an
associated code generation mechanism for RPC. Thrift provides clean
abstractions for data transport, data serialization, and application
level processing. The code generation system takes a simple definition
language as its input and generates code across programming languages that
uses the abstracted stack to build interoperable RPC clients and servers.

Thrift is specifically designed to support non-atomic version changes
across client and server code.

For more details on Thrift's design and implementation, take a gander at
the Thrift whitepaper included in this distribution or at the README files
in your particular subdirectory of interest.

Changes
=======

This repo builds up a small subset of the original Thrift C++ library.
Source ready to compile on Linux, Android (at least android-5 platform with 
exceptions and rtti enabled) and iOS.

Hierarchy
=========

thrift/

  lib/
    Contains the Thrift software library implementation, subdivided by
    language of implementation.

Requirements
============

 - LibC
 - Boost (1.47 recommended)

Acknowledgments
===============

Thrift was inspired by pillar, a lightweight RPC tool written by Adam D'Angelo,
and also by Google's protocol buffers.
